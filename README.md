# gitconfig README


This is my not so simple gitconfig. I update it from time to time with improvements.
Other people help contribute as well and attributions are in the file.
Clone this repo and sym-link it to your ~/.gitconfig on Linux or ~/_gitconfig_ on Windows

You will need to replace the section under:
[user]
    name = <YOUR NAME>
    email = <your user>@teradici.com

and put in your full name and your user_id

## Features

Some key features are:

- `git graph` to graph the current branch
- `git graphall` to graph the entire local tree
- `git recent` to show branches you've recently been in.


## Requirements

Replace YOUR NAME and your user in the current gitconfig
If you are on Windows, you will need to install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or similar shell to get some of this working.

## Known Issues

None at this time

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.
